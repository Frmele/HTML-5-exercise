Description

We have a website for our company. The company has departments, each department has a homepage. The invoicing department also has an archive.

In this exercise, we’re going to create several links to and from different pages on our website.

Follow the checklist below:


Run the REPL. You should now see the homepage for our website. This has a link to the development department page


Fold out each directory in the REPL so you can see all the HTML files. Do this on Files, at the left


Use the following diagram (see below) to see where you need to add links. Each block in the diagram is a page.


For each line from one block to another: make two links, one from block A to block B and another one from block B to block A.


Make sure to check each link to see if it links to the correct page -->
