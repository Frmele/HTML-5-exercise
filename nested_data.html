<p>The most important characters in Star Wars</p>

<!-- <ol> It is the ordered list element. 

When to use it? When we want to display a series of items in a list where the order matters. 

We could use this element to list the steps in a recipe or the actors in a movie in order of importance.

The <li> or list item element is the element that we use to create the items in a list. 

Each li element is a single item in the list. If we need 5 items in the list we should use 5 li elements.-->
<ol>
	<li>Luke</li>
	<li>Leia</li>
	<li>Han</li>
</ol>
