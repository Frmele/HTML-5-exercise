<!-- You are going to create a website for a dating app.

At the end of this course, you will create a dating app with JavaScript: "The Winc-winc 😉 app". 

To do that, you need a webpage! That's what you are going to create it now.
This exercise is the first part of the final project needed to complete the Web Development course.
You’re going to use a lot of the elements that you’ve learned about in this module. You may use other elements, but it’s not required. You need to choose wisely when to use which elements.
Scroll down, click on the open REPLIT button, fork it, and give it a good name. You will use this REPL project later, at the end of the CSS module.
Consider it finished when you have completed all the requirements below.

Requirements

The website should have 4 pages (for this exercise, forget about the other files that are not *.html). We are giving you the first one: index.html
Make sure the new HTML files are named using best practices around naming files
In the homepage (index.html) add basic information about the dating app. 
Add a “reviews” page where you can write a small reviews of your app. Just add some fake reviews about your app (we won't tell anybody 🤫).
Add a "people" page about the people you can find inside the app.
Add a "sign up" page, where users can can sign up using a form.
All pages need to use these semantic HTML elements: header, nav, main, footer.
The header element should contain a nav element with an unordered list of links to all the 4 pages in the site
Each page should use the same template (boilerplate) where the header and footer of the page are shared
The links to pages within the site need to use relative paths
Put all HTML files in the root of your site
The following pages need to have images: homepage and people.
When looking for images make sure they’re not copyrighted. Good sources of images: here and here 
Resize images that are too big
If you want to use an image: always download it and add it to your REPL. Do not hotlink!
All content images should have an alt attribute with a good value





The “sign in” page should contain a form with:
- a text input field with “name”
- a text input field with “username” 
- a form with a text area for a self description
- a few dropdowns/radio buttons/checkboxes:
- we leave this to your imagination (preferences, cities...) 
- an email field where people can leave their email
- A password
- a submit button


Each element in the form should have a label element for accessibility
Each element that can have a placeholder should have one
Do not think about spacing between the elements in your page: in the CSS module we’ll learn all about styling and layout. Do not use <br/> or empty <p> elements to create blank lines.
Use a formatter to consistently format your HTML -->
